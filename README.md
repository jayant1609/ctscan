CT Scan Image Classification Project
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the classification of CT (Computed Tomography) scan images. The model will be trained to identify specific patterns or abnormalities within CT scans, which can have applications in medical diagnosis and healthcare.

Prerequisites
List the software, libraries, or hardware requirements necessary to run your project. For example:

Python 3.6+
keras
matplotlib
NumPy
Pandas
etc.

Installation
Provide installation instructions for your project, if applicable. Include code examples for installing the necessary dependencies, creating a virtual environment, or running any setup scripts.

Data
Explain where and how to obtain the CT scan image dataset used for training and evaluation. Include any data preprocessing steps, such as resizing, normalization, or augmentation.

Training the Model
Explain how to train the CT scan image classification model. Include code snippets or commands to train the model, specify hyperparameters, and save the trained model weights.

Evaluation
Describe how to evaluate the model's performance, including metrics used (e.g., accuracy, F1 score), and provide instructions for running the evaluation script.

Model Deployment
If applicable, provide instructions for deploying the trained model in a real-world application. This could include creating APIs or web applications for clinicians or other end-users.

Contributing
Explain how others can contribute to your project. Include guidelines for submitting issues, feature requests, or pull requests. You may also list any coding standards or code review processes.

License
Specify the license under which your project is released. It could be open source, MIT, Apache, or any other license that you choose.

Acknowledgments
If you used any external libraries, datasets, or code snippets, give credit by acknowledging them in this section.

Authors
List the authors or contributors to the project and include their contact information.

References
Include any references to papers, articles, or websites that you used as inspiration or guidance for your project.

Conclusion
Summarize the key takeaways from your project and mention any future developments or improvements you plan to make.

Remember that a README file should be informative, clear, and well-structured to help other users understand and use your project effectively. Update this README as your project evolves and improves.
